# Particle-System-Project
A project completed as part of the COMP37111 module, Advanced Computer Graphics.

A skeleton code outline was given to help with initialising the enviroment, but the rest was designed, coded and implemented by me.

The choice of particle system was chosen to simulate snow falling to the ground from a single source.

Additional features were implemented to allow the user to control the wind speed (in 3 dimensions) and the gravity of the system, using keyboard controls.

A full write up of the project, including design choice justfication and explanation are available.
